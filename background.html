            <p> <!--intro to our topic and why we chose this topic-->
                Our Statistics group wanted to find out which fashion brand's clothing would yield the most sales
                in the USA this year. We chose this topic because we're all interested in fashion. Though, originally,
                we had a completely different topic. Our original topic was finding out what the favourite movie genres
                of highschoolers. We ditched that idea however as we encountered problems with our data set. Nonetheless,
                we were able to think of a new idea, and it is something we all liked! It's also something easy to understand!

                <p> <!--additional info of our topic-->
                    Since all the prices were listed in US Dollars, we inferred that the data was collected within the USA. Additionally, 
                    the last update on the dataset was made four months ago, leading us to conclude that the information was gathered this 
                    year. The data was gathered in the form of a survey. Although the exact number of respondents wasn't mentioned, it is 
                    probable to assume that they were most likely American individuals with an interest towards fashion and clothing.
